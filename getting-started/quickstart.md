# Quickstart


Here is a template that will help you quickstart your project:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
    <title>Hello, world!</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/samsunginternet/OneUI-Web/oui-css/oui.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <main class="container">
      <div class="viewing">
          <!-- Viewing area -->
      </div>
      <div class="content">
          <!-- Interaction area -->
      </div>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```


## From the Source

### 1st step - Download the release from OneUI Web REPO

This is the easiest step. Here is is the link from where the releases are available:
https://github.com/SamsungInternet/OneUI-Web/releases/latest

Download it and place it in your projects folder

### 2nd step - Include it

Include it on your page by adding the css stylesheet to your page: 
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="OneUI/oui.css">
```

Here is what your page should look like.
```
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
    <title>Hello, world!</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="OneUI/oui.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <main class="container">
      <div class="viewing">
          <!-- Viewing area -->
      </div>
      <div class="content">
          <!-- Interaction area -->
      </div>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>

```
